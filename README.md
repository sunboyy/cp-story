# Instruction

1. Using a git command to clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse and then "import existing project" from the cloned folder (In Step 1) into your Eclipse workspace.
3. Rename your Eclipse Java project: **`2110215_Project_2017_{GroupName}`**. 
    - Example: If your group name is **`Rockman`**, your project name should be **`2110215_Project_2017_Rockman`**.
4. Implement your project. 
    - You should create a commit when you finish each function of your project. 
    - Don't wait until you finish the whole project to create a commit.
5. Export your project into a runnable jar file named **`Project_2017_{GroupName}.jar`**
    - Example: If your group name is **`Rockman`**, your jar name should be **`Project_2017_Rockman.jar`**.
    - Your jar file must include all your resources (images or audios) and it must be runnable from anywhere.
6. Create a PDF document of your project and put it at the root directory. 
    - Your document should contain:
        - Brief introduction about your project.
        - User Manual (How to use your program or How to play if your project is a game).
        - Implementation Detail (UML class diagram and description of all classes and methods you implemented)
    - The document of each lab or exercise is a great example of how your document should look like.
7. Ensure that you push all commits of your project within **14 December 2017**.
    - To sum up, this repository should contain:
        - All your codes.
        - Runnable jar file.
        - PDF Document.
        - An image of the UML class diagram.
8. **On your presentation day (15 December 2017)**, bring a printed version of your document and your own laptop for showing a demo of your project.
    - **You only have 5 minutes for showing a demo of your project. So make sure that your laptop is ready for presentation beforehand.**
